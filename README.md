# Passport_Checks

This is to confirm the DB has up to date passports

This script is to check the Sabre Crewtrac DB for passports with incorrect 1930 (+) dates and expired passports for active crewmembers to display on webpage.

The PSTools.ps1 is a collection of functions which the other scipts use. This file needs to be in C:\bat\function folder.
passport-check and Passport_report need a scheduled task (1 for each script)

Passport-check - will find any employee with a passport experation date in 1900's and changes to 2000's
Will log changes into event viewer for tracking purposes.
finally will get a list of active (or on leave) crew members with expired passports and save it to a web page

Passport_Report - will grab all events that where generated by the passport-check script and e-mail report.

Schedule tasks

1. Passport-check could run once an hour or so, Doesn't need to be realtime.
2. Passport_Report only needs to run once a day and will grab any events from the previous day.

The schedule tasks are exported as .xml files to be imported.
